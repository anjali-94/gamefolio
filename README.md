# Personal-JS-7-Platformer

This started as an attempt to create a 2d side scroller and later grew into my personal portfolio. Due to growing complexity and new gained experience, I've decided to split it into two separate projects:
* [Portfolio ](https://github.com/lkatkus/Portfolio) - started from scratch with React.
* [LaikaJS](https://github.com/lkatkus/LaikaJS) - reused parts of the current code, but mainly rewritten to be  stand-alone library.
